My name is Samantha Marie Lewis. I was born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina. I have also lived in Rexburg, Idaho and Denton, Texas. I graduated from the University of North Carolina Wilmington with a BA in English in 2016, and again in 2019 with a Masters of Teaching in Secondary Education. I am currently enrolled in the University of North Carolina Greensboro in the Masters of Library and Information Science program. My main interests are User Experience and Assessment, Social Media and Youth/Young Adult Services. 

My favorite hobbies are writing, reading, playing video games and looking at paintings of forest and nature scenary and cute dogs on the internet. I currently live in Wilmington, NC with my husband Taylor and Maltese Genji.
